\section{Results (\textit{Jacob Salomonsen})}



\subsection{Running time}\label{sec:runningtime}
After running the test described in \autoref{sec:testing} on both the CPU- and the GPU-version, we got the following results. \autoref{results} shows the resultant graphs by plotting the size of the simulated field against the the average column of \autoref{resultcpu} and \autoref{resultgpu}.

The graphs on \autoref{results} shows a clear sign that the GPU-based version is faster than the CPU-based version, but that the implementations also exhibit the same time complexity. The graphs have the same shape and are reminiscent of a quadratic functions. Although this can be observed, is is beyond the scope of this report to verify it.



\subsection{Other characteristics}
As a secondary result, the result of simulating the lid driven cavity can be compared with a reference from another implementation, as to see if the implementation performs in the way one would expect. In \autoref{lidimages}, the reference images is \autoref{lidref}, taken from \cite{lidref}. Although they are not exactly the same our implementation exhibits the same pattern as in the reference solution.
